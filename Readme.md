A set of unofficial mods for [Mars Horizon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/765810/Mars_Horizon/) (2020 game). <br>
Tested on game version 1.4.1.  Windows (Mono) build only.

- **[Direct Downloads](https://github.com/Sheep-y/MarsHorizonMods/releases)**

[BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx#readme) (v5) is recommended.
Or use the included Simple Mars Horizon Mod Loader, or [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21). <br>
See [this document](https://github.com/Sheep-y/MarsHorizonMods/blob/main/ModLoader/Alternatives.md) for BepInEx / UMM setup,
or the simple mod loader's [readme](https://github.com/Sheep-y/MarsHorizonMods/blob/main/ModLoader/Readme.md) for its setup.

Mods list:

* **Click Reduction** - The mod that everyone wants.  Renders mini-game unstable, but should be worth it.
* **Deep Space Slots** - Unlockable additional slots for long missions.
* **Informed** - See launch windows, total base synergies, mission expiry and payload options, and other information.
* **Mission Control** - Give Earth/Monn mission higher weights and other missions less weights.
* **Payload Checkup** - Adjust auto-resolve success rate by payload, and tie positive event chance to reliability.
* **Zhant** - Convert Simplified Chinese into Traditional Chinese, and try to fix the horrible translation.
